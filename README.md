# CNN-soil-image-classification

Here, I tried to classify different types of soil based on image recognition via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). I used Adam Optimizer from Keras.

The accuracy I got was around 90%. It can be improved by using supporting data on soil pH, texture and drainage which will be used to ensemble the CNN with a Random Forest Regression algorithm.

The data used for this is comes from google images. There were then saved into seperate files based on their soil class into 4 types (Alluvial, Black, Clay, Red).
